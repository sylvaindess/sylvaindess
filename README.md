### 🎯 About Me

I'm a computer science undergraduate with a background in healthcare and chemistry and a strong interest in **neuroscience, molecular biology, and cognitive science**. My research direction explores how **AI, bioinformatics, and language-based models** can contribute to understanding and detecting **neurodegenerative diseases** like Alzheimer's.

Through this GitHub, I document:

- Clinical NLP tools for detecting early cognitive decline
- Experiments at the interface of bioinformatics and neuroscience
- Learning pathways in machine learning, modeling, and biomedical AI

I’m currently active as a **recruitment manager at the [Club d'intelligence artificielle de l'Université Laval](https://github.com/cia-ulaval)**, where we democratize AI through applied, student-led research.

### 🔬 Research Interests

**🧠 Neurodegeneration & Early Detection**  
Investigating behavioral and linguistic biomarkers for early signs of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.

**🧬 Protein Function in Neurological Disorders**  
Exploring the role of proteins like Cypin in synaptic regulation and neurodegeneration using data mining and pathway modeling.

**🧫 Bioinformatics & Network Analysis**  
Building gene–protein interaction networks to uncover mechanisms of cognitive disease and identify therapeutic targets.

**💬 Clinical NLP & Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
Applying natural language processing and foundation models to extract insights from clinical notes and biomedical literature.

**🧑‍⚕️ Human-Centered AI Tools**  
Designing assistive technologies to support patients, caregivers, and clinicians in the context of cognitive health.

### 📘 Learning Journal & Blog

I’m [documenting my research journey](https://sylvaindess.github.io/) in AI, neuroscience, and bioinformatics as I build a portfolio at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive health.

Future blog posts will cover:

- Extracting imaging biomarkers of brain aging (MRI data, OASIS)  
- Detecting early signs of Alzheimer’s through NLP and linguistic cues  
- Exploring protein networks involved in cognitive decline  
- Building tools with LLMs for biomedical insight and accessibility.

Blog posts will be published gradually throughout August and September.
